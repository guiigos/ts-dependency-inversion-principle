# TypeScript Dependency Inversion Principle
The **DIP** (*Dependency Inversion Principle*) is one of the principles of **SOLID**, a set of software design principles aimed at promoting flexible, scalable, and maintainable systems. The main idea behind this principle is to reduce coupling between modules, making them more independent of each other. This allows for greater flexibility and extensibility, as it becomes easier to substitute concrete implementations with alternative ones. It also simplifies unit testing.
